                    <p><strong>Q: What if a vehicle gets stuck and can't move?</strong><br>

These practical tips will help you: first analyze the entire parking lot layout and identify which vehicles are key blockers; start clearing from the perimeter, gradually opening channels for target vehicles; use idle areas as temporary parking spaces to rearrange vehicles; pay attention to vehicle movement direction restrictions - some vehicles can only move forward or backward; in complex levels, formulate an overall strategy before starting to move, avoiding blind operations that lead to deadlocks.</p>
